## User Stories

As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and alcoholContent.

As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.

As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.

As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg.

As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.
